  <p>
    I like listening to music and watching movies/YouTube.<br>
    I used to like playing video games and reading but I've slowed down recently. <br>
    I prefer doing something passive while I'm focused on work.<br>
    I've visited many countries in Europe. I still would like to visit Sweden and also South Korean and Japan in Asia. <br>
    I'd like to explore more of the US as well. I like the idea of a road trip between New York and California.
