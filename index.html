  <h1>60-205 Project</h1>
  <h2>Student: Amine Gherib</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Amine and I'm a fourth year computer science student currently doing a 16-month internship at IBM in Markham.<br>
    I've already done the World Wide Web Information System Development course in my previous semester. <br>
    For the final project, me and my classmate created a website with a pomodoro timer with an UX design with accessibility for the visually impaired<br>
    and with configurable timing settings for different subjects that can be saved for each user in a scalable database.<br>
    <br>
    I've also taken Computer Networks so I'm familiar with topics like internet protocols, communication encryption, addressing, network security<br>
    and so on. My term paper was on IP security.
